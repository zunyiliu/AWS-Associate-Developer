AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the cryptographic keys that are used to protect your data. 
AWS KMS integrates with most other AWS services that encrypt your data. AWS KMS also integrates with AWS CloudTrail to log use of your KMS keys for auditing, regulatory, and compliance needs.
You can use the AWS KMS API to create and manage KMS keys and special features, such as custom key stores, and use KMS keys in cryptographic operations.

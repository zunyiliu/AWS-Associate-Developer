## encryption
### 1. server side
Amazon S3 encrypts your objects before saving them on disks in AWS data centers and then decrypts the objects when you download them.  
Specifying server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)  
Specifying server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)  
Specifying dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS)  
Specifying server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C)  
### 2. client side 
encrypt your data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. 

### Enforcing encryption in transit with the use of Amazon CloudFront
configure your S3 bucket policy to only allow access from the CloudFront distribution
### security with encrypted connections
allowing only encrypted connections over HTTPS (TLS) by using the aws:SecureTransport condition

## Troubleshooting
unable to create a state machine -- IAM permission  
delay in state transitions -- When you exceed the state transition limit, Step Functions delays state transitions until the bucket for the quota is filled  
ExecutionLimitExceeded -- each AWS account in each AWS Region has a limit number of executions  
## InputPath, ResultPath, and OutputPath
### InputPath
control what data passes to state
### ResultPath
control what data passes to output(can filter unwanted data)
### OutputPath
control what data passes to next state
